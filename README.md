Goal



#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Procedure

#Read data from raw text files into data frames (data assumed to be downloaded prior to script execution)
#Merge test and train subject data.
#Merge test and train y data. Merge resulting y data with activity labels.
#Merge test and train x data. Apply feature data as feature names.
#Combine merged subject, x and y data (results from 2,3,4).
#Subset to only mean & stdv features.
#Compute means grouped by subject and activity.
#Write results to the tiny_data_set_with_the_averages.txt file.
